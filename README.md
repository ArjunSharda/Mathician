Mathician is a math package that uses the math package (some of it) and it's own code. It is created by Arjun Sharda with the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhpI6Yhz9_4, and it is one simple python package that can be used, although very basic and does not have many features. 

Mathician is open-sourced and is free for everyone to use, fork, etc, under the repository's license.

In short, Mathician is a basic math package with not a lot of features and uses the math package. It is a python package created by Arjun Sharda and can be installed with the PyPi package manager, though.
