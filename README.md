Mathician is a math package that uses the math package (some of it) and it's own code. Created by Arjun Sharda with the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhpI6Yhz9_4, it is one simple python package that can be used, although very basic and not many features.

Mathician uses the ``math`` package aswell and it's own code. Mathician is open-sourced and is free for everyone to use under the MIT license.
